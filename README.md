## üìä Projects:

### 1. [Banking Domain Data Visualization](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNmE0NDBkNGYtZmQ4Ni00ZDI2LWI5MGUtMGE1Njg4N2JjODI5IiwidCI6IjM0YmQ4YmVkLTJhYzEtNDFhZS05ZjA4LTRlMGEzZjExNzA2YyJ9)

Problem:

Banks often deal with large volumes of data related to customer transactions, account balances, loan histories, and various financial metrics. Managing and analyzing this data manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Additionally, key decision-makers within the banking sector need access to real-time, actionable insights to make informed decisions regarding customer behavior, financial risk, and loan performance. The challenge is to transform raw data into meaningful information that can be easily interpreted and used to drive data-driven decisions.

Solution:

This project addresses the problem by using SQL to extract, clean, and transform raw banking data into a structured format. Power BI is then used to create interactive and real-time dashboards that visualize customer transactions, account balances, loan histories, and other financial metrics. These dashboards allow stakeholders to explore the data, identify trends, and gain actionable insights. By using Excel for additional data processing and calculations, the project ensures data accuracy and delivers comprehensive, user-friendly visualizations. This empowers banking decision-makers to efficiently monitor key metrics and make informed, data-driven decisions.


   - **Technologies**: Power BI, SQL, Excel

   - **Abbreviations Used**:

**Problem:**

For a goods company, understanding sales and profit trends across various regions, customer segments, and product categories is essential for optimizing business strategies and improving profitability.
